If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.\n\nMind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow.\n\n\"He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me.\" Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.\n\n\"He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me.\" Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred.\n\nHatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal.\n\nThere are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels."

    title: "Heart Sutra",
    tradition: "Mahayana Buddhist",
    year: "1st Century CE",
    content: "The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, while moving in the deep course of Perfect Understanding, shed light on the five skandhas and found them equally empty. After this penetration, he overcame all pain.\n\nListen, Sariputra, form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Form is not other than emptiness, emptiness is not other than form. The same is true with feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness.\n\nListen, Sariputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness; they are neither produced nor destroyed, neither defiled nor immaculate, neither increasing nor decreasing.\n\nTherefore, in emptiness there is neither form, nor feeling, nor perception, nor mental formations, nor consciousness; no eye, or ear, or nose, or tongue, or body, or mind; no form, or sound, or smell, or taste, or touch, or object of mind; no realm of eyes, until we come to no realm of mind consciousness.\n\nThere is no ignorance, and no end to ignorance, until we come to no old age and death and no end to old age and death. There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no end to suffering, no path. There is no attainment and no non-attainment.\n\nTherefore, Sariputra, without attainment, bodhisattvas take refuge in Perfect Understanding and live without walls of the mind. Without walls of the mind and thus without fears, they see through delusions and finally nirvana.\n\nAll Buddhas of the past, present, and future, thanks to this Perfect Understanding, arrive at full, right, and universal Enlightenment.\n\nTherefore, one should know that Perfect Understanding is the highest mantra, the unequalled mantra, the destroyer of all suffering, the incorruptible truth. A mantra of Prajnaparamita should therefore be proclaimed:\n\nGate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!"

    tradition: "Hindu",
    year: "800-500 BCE",
    content: "As the flowing rivers disappear into the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise man, freed from name and form, attains the Purusha, who is greater than the Great.\n\nAs rivers, flowing down, become indistinguishable on reaching the sea by giving up their names and forms, so also the illumined soul, having become freed from name and form, reaches the self-effulgent Purusha that is higher than the highest.\n\nIn the beginning was the Self alone, in the shape of a person. He looking around saw nothing but his Self. He first said, 'I am.' Therefore arose the name I. Therefore, even today, when one is addressed, he first says, 'It is I,' and then says the other name that he may have.\n\nAs the same non-dual fire, after it has entered the world, becomes different according to whatever it burns, so also the same non-dual Atman, dwelling in all beings, becomes different according to whatever it enters. And it exists also without.\n\nAs the same non-dual air, after it has entered the world, becomes different according to whatever it enters, so also the same non-dual Atman, dwelling in all beings, becomes different according to whatever it enters. And it exists also without.\n\nBy understanding the Self, in whose presence there is neither day nor night, neither existence nor non-existence, one transcends all the pains of the heart."

    content: "What you seek is seeking you.\n\nYou are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.\n\nThe wound is the place where the Light enters you.\n\nYesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.\n\nStop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.\n\nSilence is the language of God, all else is poor translation.\n\nLet yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.\n\nYour task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.\n\nThe minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.\n\nDon't grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.\n\nThe garden of the world has no limits, except in your mind.\n\nDance, when you're broken open. Dance, if you've torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you're perfectly free."

    id: "tibetan-book",
    title: "The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying",
    tradition: "Tibetan Buddhist",
    year: "1992 (based on ancient teachings)",
    content: "Perhaps the deepest reason why we are afraid of death is because we do not know who we are. We believe in a personal, unique, and separate identity; but if we dare to examine it, we find that this identity depends entirely on an endless collection of things to prop it up: our name, our 'biography,' our partners, family, home, job, friends, credit cards... It is on their fragile and transient support that we rely for our security. So when they are all taken away, will we have any idea of who we really are?\n\nWithout our familiar props, we are faced with just ourselves, a person we do not know, an unnerving stranger with whom we have been living all the time but we never really wanted to meet. Isn't that why we have tried to fill every moment of time with noise and activity, however boring or trivial, to ensure that we are never left in silence with this stranger on our own?\n\nAnd doesn't this point to something fundamentally tragic about our way of life? We live under an assumed identity, in a neurotic fairy tale world with no more reality than the Mock Turtle in Alice in Wonderland. Hypnotized by the thrill of building, we have raised the houses of our lives on sand.\n\nThis world can seem marvelously convincing until death collapses the illusion and evicts us from our hiding place. What will happen to us then if we have no clue of any deeper reality?\n\nWhen we finally know we are dying, and all other sentient beings are dying with us, we start to have a burning, almost heartbreaking sense of the fragility and preciousness of each moment and each being, and from this can grow a deep, clear, limitless compassion for all beings."
